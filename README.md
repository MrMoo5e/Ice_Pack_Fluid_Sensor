# Ice_Pack_Fluid_Sensor
Sensor to detect leaks after a plastic cap has been welded on and relay the information to a PLC. 
The program reads a RobotCore water sensor with an arduino analog pin and outputs a 24V signal to the PLC input pin.
The sensor is supposed to sense droplets of the ice pack fluid that drip out of the cap when a bottle with a bad weld is 
squeezed.
